# Orma Messenger

**in development**

**Orma** is a free, privacy-first messenger designed for secure communication.  
We do not store logs, track your messages, or see what you write — because we can't.  
All messages are end-to-end encrypted. Even our server has no way to decrypt them.

## Why Orma?

In a world of constant surveillance, Orma gives you a space to speak freely.  
We believe secure communication should be fast, simple, and open to everyone — without compromise.
